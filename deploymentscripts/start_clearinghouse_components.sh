#   start_clearinghouse_components.sh
# 
# <Purpose>
#   This script will start the various components of the Clearinghouse in the 
#   correct order (namely, lockserver first, then backend, then the rest). It 
#   will also gracefully restart Apache. This script should be used rather than
#   stopping/starting components individually to ensure that all components use
#   a fresh lockserver after they have been restarted.
#
# <Usage>
#    As root, run:
#      ./start_clearinghouse_components.sh
#    Once started, the processes will not exit until its children have. To kill
#    all components of the clearinghouse (except Apache), send a SIGINT or 
#    SIGTERM to this process.
